# Breakout Elite - Stanford Code in Place 2025
A modern, feature-rich implementation of the classic Breakout game with enhanced graphics, particle effects, power-ups, and smooth gameplay.

**Final Project Submission for Stanford Code in Place 2025**  
*Submitted by: Ahmed M. Fayad*

## Project Structure
The project has been organized into multiple modules for better maintainability and code organization:

### Core Files
- **`main.py`** - Main entry point and game orchestration
- **`config.py`** - All game configuration constants and settings
- **`game_objects.py`** - Game object classes (Particle, PowerUp, GameState)
- **`game_creation.py`** - Functions for creating game objects (bricks, paddle, ball)
- **`physics.py`** - Physics calculations and collision detection
- **`game_logic.py`** - Main game loop and turn logic
- **`visuals.py`** - Visual effects, UI components, and particle systems

## Features

### Enhanced Gameplay
- **Multi-turn System**: Play multiple rounds with cumulative scoring
- **Combo System**: Chain brick destructions for bonus points
- **Power-ups**: Collect falling power-ups for special abilities
  - ðŸ”„ **Expand**: Increases paddle size
  - âš¡ **Speed**: Slows down ball for easier control
  - âœ¦ **Multi**: Future feature for multiple balls

### Visual Effects
- **Particle Explosions**: Dynamic particle effects when bricks are destroyed
- **Enhanced Graphics**: Gradient bricks, highlighted paddles and balls
- **Starfield Background**: Animated star field for ambiance
- **Universal Color Scheme**: Colors that work well on both light and dark backgrounds

### Game Mechanics
- **Physics-based Ball Movement**: Realistic ball physics with spin effects
- **Smart Paddle Control**: Mouse-controlled paddle with collision-based spin
- **Progressive Scoring**: Different point values for different brick rows
- **Win/Loss Conditions**: Clear all bricks to win, lose ball to lose turn

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have the `graphics.py` library available
2. Run the main game file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Code Organization Benefits

### Separation of Concerns
- **Configuration**: All constants in one place for easy tweaking
- **Game Objects**: Clean class definitions with clear responsibilities  
- **Physics**: Isolated collision detection and movement calculations
- **Visuals**: All UI and effects code separated from game logic
- **Creation**: Object instantiation logic kept separate from game loop

### Maintainability
- **Modular Design**: Easy to modify individual components without affecting others
- **Clear Dependencies**: Each module has well-defined imports and responsibilities
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new features like additional power-ups or game modes

### Code Reusability
- **Shared Constants**: Universal color scheme and game settings
- **Utility Functions**: Reusable functions for common operations
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Classes can be extended for new functionality

## Extending the Game

### Adding New Power-ups
1. Add the power-up type to `POWERUP_COLORS` and `POWERUP_SYMBOLS` in `config.py`
2. Implement the effect in `GameState.apply_powerup()` in `game_objects.py`
3. Add the power-up to the random selection in `game_logic.py`

### Adding New Visual Effects
1. Create new particle types in `game_objects.py`
2. Add visual functions to `visuals.py`
3. Integrate effects into the game loop in `game_logic.py`

### Modifying Game Balance
1. Adjust constants in `config.py`
2. Modify scoring logic in `game_logic.py`
3. Update physics parameters in `physics.py`

## Dependencies
- `graphics.py` - Graphics library for canvas operations
- Standard Python libraries: `time`, `random`, `math`

## Game Controls
- **Mouse**: Control paddle position
- **Click**: Start game and advance through screens
